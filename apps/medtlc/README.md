# MedTLC

Medication - Track. Learn. Connect.

## Description

MedTLC was designed and created in collaboration with MedSocket's pharmacists and physicians. There are many apps that simply track medications and issue reminders to users. However, one huge missing gap was tracking one's health responses and communicating these to those who can help.

MedTLC was developed to specifically focus on medications, how they affect the individual taking them, and to connect this information to their medical practitioners early enough to avoid complications.

With MedTLC you can follow these quick steps to improve your health
 1. Enter Your Medications
 2. Record "How I Feel" Responses
 3. Create Reports of Your Responses and Choose to Connect With Your Doctors
